	abstract = {Embeddings of words and concepts capture syntactic and semantic regularities of language; however, they have seen limited use as tools to study characteristics of different corpora and how they relate to one another. We introduce TextEssence, an interactive system designed to enable comparative analysis of corpora using embeddings. TextEssence includes visual, neighbor-based, and similarity-based modes of embedding analysis in a lightweight, web-based interface. We further propose a new measure of embedding confidence based on nearest neighborhood overlap, to assist in identifying high-quality embeddings for corpus analysis. A case study on COVID-19 scientific literature illustrates the utility of the system. TextEssence can be found at https://textessence.github.io.},

@article{10.1093/jamia/ocaa269,
	abstract = {{Normalizing mentions of medical concepts to standardized vocabularies is a fundamental component of clinical text analysis. Ambiguity---words or phrases that may refer to different concepts---has been extensively researched as part of information extraction from biomedical literature, but less is known about the types and frequency of ambiguity in clinical text. This study characterizes the distribution and distinct types of ambiguity exhibited by benchmark clinical concept normalization datasets, in order to identify directions for advancing medical concept normalization research.We identified ambiguous strings in datasets derived from the 2 available clinical corpora for concept normalization and categorized the distinct types of ambiguity they exhibited. We then compared observed string ambiguity in the datasets with potential ambiguity in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to assess how representative available datasets are of ambiguity in clinical language.We found that \\&lt;15\\% of strings were ambiguous within the datasets, while over 50\\% were ambiguous in the UMLS, indicating only partial coverage of clinical ambiguity. The percentage of strings in common between any pair of datasets ranged from 2\\% to only 36\\%; of these, 40\\% were annotated with different sets of concepts, severely limiting generalization. Finally, we observed 12 distinct types of ambiguity, distributed unequally across the available datasets, reflecting diverse linguistic and medical phenomena.Existing datasets are not sufficient to cover the diversity of clinical concept ambiguity, limiting both training and evaluation of normalization methods for clinical text. Additionally, the UMLS offers important semantic information for building and evaluating normalization methods.Our findings identify 3 opportunities for concept normalization research, including a need for ambiguity-specific clinical datasets and leveraging the rich semantics of the UMLS in new methods and evaluation measures for normalization.}},

	abstract = {One of the most popular speech recognition architectures consists of multiple components (like the acoustic, pronunciation and language models) that are modeled as weighted finite state transducer (WFST) factors in a cascade. These factor WFSTs are typically trained in isolation and combined efficiently for decoding. Recent work has explored jointly estimating parameters for these models using considerable amounts of training data. We propose an alternative approach to selectively train factor WFSTs in such an architecture, while still leveraging information from the entire cascade. This technique allows us to effectively estimate parameters of a factor WFST using relatively small amounts of data, if the factor is small. Our approach involves an online training paradigm for linear models adapted for discriminatively training one or more WFSTs in a cascade. We apply this method to train a pronunciation model for recognition on conversational speech, resulting in significant improvements in recognition performance over the baseline model.},
